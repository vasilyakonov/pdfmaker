# Journal for Raw Visual Data

Journal for Raw Visual Data is a generative publication about how chance operation can influence content. The script searches Microsoft Bing for images under a randomly chosen topic and and constructs a publication from these findings. The positioning if the images constructs a perceived narrative, as a series of any images put in a certain order would. Almost comic like, sometimes seemingly documentational, sometimes nonsensical of a certain topic in the corpora. 

The script constructs a narrative for the topic that the random generator selects and publishes it to a publicly avaliable dropbox folder, that the readers could doenload the publication from.

The nature of the corpora that suggest fututristic concepts and avant-garde technologies makes the contents fairly saturated with sci-fi illustrations, blueprints, schemes and crosssections as well as closeups of technology, that themselves provide a certain narrative path throughout the publications.
