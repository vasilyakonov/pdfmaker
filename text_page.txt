This publication contains a compilation of images, picked at random from a Mi*****ft B*ng web search by an algorithm written in python. The list of possible queries is based on  Botwiki's corpora api "new technologies" list on GitHub.

It's contents may be confusing, explicit or completely non sequitur. 

The purpose of the Journal is to explore the possibilities of application of accidental content in a somewhat curated form by sampling data from a randomised and contextually inconsistent stream of information and compilining it in a pdf that could be printed and distributed as a publication.
